<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

With advances in simulating astrophysical fluid flows and radiative transfer simulations through the flows, MCRaT represents a next generation radiative transfer simulation that conducts radiative calculations using the background of realistic fluid flow profiles that have been acquired from hydrodynamically simulated outflows. Although MCRaT has primarily been used to study the emission from Gamma Ray Burst jets, it can also be used to study the emission from other astrophysical phenomenon such as jets from Active Galactic Nuclei and Tidal Disruption Events.

MCRaT injects photons into a hydrodynamic simulation of an outflow and calculates the evolution of the trapped radiation within the fluid until the end of the hydrodynamic simulation.  In simulating the radiation, MCRaT takes  a number of physical processes into account including:
* Compton Scattering 
* The Klein–Nishina Cross Section Including the Effects of Polarization
* Cyclo-synchrotron Emission and Absorption

Once the MCRaT calculations have completed, users can construct mock observed light curves, spectra, and polarization measurements from the MCRaT results using the [ProcessMCRaT](https://github.com/parsotat/ProcessMCRaT) package. 

Currently, MCRaT can be used to analyze the output of FLASH and PLUTO hydrodynamic simulations in the specified dimensions and coordinate systems:
* FLASH
  - 2D: Cartesian and Cylindrical 
* PLUTO (.dbl files only) and PLUTO-Chombo
  - 2D/2.5D: Cartesian, Cylindrical, and Spherical
  - 3D: Cartesian, Polar, and Spherical
    
Additionally, MCRaT can analyze PLUTO and PLUTO-Chombo magneto-hydrodynamic simulations in the same dimensions and coordinate systems specified above.

### Built With

* [Message Passing Interface (MPI)](http://www.open-mpi.org/)
* [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org//)
* [The GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
* [The HDF5 library](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

The following are necessary to compile the MCRaT code and should be installed in the manner that each packages specifies:
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [ICC](https://software.intel.com/en-us/c-compilers) 
* [Message Passing Interface (MPI)](http://www.open-mpi.org/)
* [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org//)  -- typically comes with the GCC or ICC compiler
* [The GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
* [The HDF5 library](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) -- need to install the serial and parallel versions (v1.10 and greater)

In addition to the above, you will also need a hydrodynamical simulation that you want to calculate radiation from. Currently, this can be a FLASH, PLUTO, or PLUTO-Chombo simulation with dimensions and coordinates previously specified.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lazzati-astro/MCRaT.git
   ```
2. Copy one of the template Makefile files into the `Src/` directory and rename it `Makefile` if necessary. The file named `Makefile` is a template for a smaller compute cluster while the file named `Makefile_supercomputer` is a template for compiling MCRaT on a supercomputer using `icc`.
   ```sh
   cp Makefile_supercomputer Src/Makefile 
   ```
3. Modify the `Makefile` to specify the location of the installed prerequisite libraries that are needed to compile MCRaT. In some rare cases this may not need to be done if the system that the user is on uses modules and paths are set correctly.
4. Set the necessary parameters in the `mcrat_input.h` file and the `mc.par` file for the hydrodynamics simulations that MCRaT is using and the physical processes that the user wants MCRaT to consider
5. Compile the code by running
    ```sh
    make 
    ```
6. Run the MCRaT code using mpiexec 

_These steps are provided in greater detail in the  [Documentation](https://github.com/lazzati-astro/MCRaT/tree/master/Doc)_


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The typical MCRaT workflow is as follows:

1. Compile MCRaT as was briefly mentioned in the previous section
2. Run the MCRaT code 
3. Process the output of the MCRaT calculations using the included `Merge` code
4. Use the [ProcessMCRaT](https://github.com/parsotat/ProcessMCRaT) library to produce mock observed light curves, spectra, and polarization measurements for the simulated astrophysical outflow

The video below shows an example of MCRaT scattering photons through a Gamma Ray Burst jet. MCRaT allows us to track the evolution fo the photon spectrum as they photons propagate through the jet and as the jet propagates through space. Additionally, we can keep track of how well the photons are in equilibrium with the matter in the jet, as indicated by the effective temperatures.
